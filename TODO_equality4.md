motivation for DPP alpha
simulate from h0, set H0 such that expected cluster from Dirichlet is fixed.

For both Scott & Berger, and big simulation use these prior settings:

DPP alpha = .5, 1, Gopalan Berry
work out Gopalan Berry computation for alpha (see what Fabian added to Overleaf)
find a reference for a hyperprior for alpha -> does this need to jave infinite density at zero or zero density at zero?

BetaBinomial: (1, 1) & (n_groups, 1)


Example:
proportion model with statistical errors





31-05-2020 For the talk!

for visualizePriors we want

- [x] BetaBinomial: (1, 1) & (n_groups, 1)
- [x] DPP: 0.5, 1, Gopalan Berry

- [x] Add alpha 0.5 for the simulations!

- [x] drop Scott & Berger figure

- [x] one_or_more_errors.png -> Adjust the DPP to be 1, .5, and Gopalan Berry
- [x] change y-axis to say "at least one error"

- [x] cut slide on DPP rich get richer
- [x] cut title on slide "Comparison of Priors"
- [x] cut slide on Scott & Berger plot

- [ ] colors + shapes in Illustration slide should be the same everywhere
